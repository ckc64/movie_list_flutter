## Packages :

### http: ^0.13.4
http because I just need the basic network tasks, it already have what I need.
</br>
### mobx: ^2.0.7+4
I used mobx for my statemanagement because it is really straightforward. I only use one state management because having two is too omuch and overkill for a small applications plus the complexity .
</br>

### cached_network_image: ^3.2.1
I used the cached_network_image package instead of using what's available on flutter(Image.network). cached_network_image package is really good when fetching images from web because it cache the images and can be used offline.
</br>

### youtube_player_flutter: ^8.1.0
this package is a really easy to use it saves me so much time because I just need the youtube "id" of the video to make it work.
</br>

### carousel_slider: ^4.1.1
I used carousel on video list/slider instead  of having a listview with scrollDirection:Axis.horizontal because the carousel package already have what I need  for animation like auto scrolling of list, the curve animation and etc...
